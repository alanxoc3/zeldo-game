# That Story About Zeldo
Lank wakes up from a good night's rest only to find Hi-roll in danger! You gotta
help him save the Land of Hi-roll from the forces of evil.

Enjoy my game. Made with <3 in PICO-8.

## Dependencies
You must have a unix-like environment to compile this project. In addition, you
must have the latest version of PICO-8 available in your path as `pico8`. The
scripts included in this repository have been tested on Linux, and also Windows
using Git bash.

## Building
Before you open `zeldo.p8`, you must build the code. Just run `./compile` to do
that.

If you want the code to be minified, run `./compile -m`. If you want debugging
super powers, run `./compile -d`.

## Releasing
Run `./compile_prod`. Then export the cartridge as a `.p8.png` image through
pico8.

## Running Mapbuilder
To run the map builder tool, just run `./mapbuilder`.
