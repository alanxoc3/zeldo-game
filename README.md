# That Story About Zeldo

- create 2 parts of lank (feet and arms).

## Thoughts
For the saving logic, what are the saving conditions?
- mem_loc goes to a state.
- mem_loc decides whether or not the object is loaded.
- mem_loc decides whether an item is available.
- mem_loc holds numbers (money and health information).

Really, mem_loc isn't specific to any one thing. So it shouldn't be handled
with everything.
