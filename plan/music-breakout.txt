There are 6 different areas. Each area gets 8 sfx slots and 8 music slots.

8 sfx slots are reserved for sound effects.
8 sfx slots are reserved for shared melody between different songs.

16 music slots are reserved for title screen, game over, and ending screens.


This was part of a commit message:

I have the map divided out between the different music areas now.


I'll probably have these songs:

6 types of songs:
- Village & House      - 5 & 7
- Woods & Woods Boss   - 1 & 7
- Overworld            - 1 & 4 & 2
- Castle & Castle Boss - 
- Crypt & Crypt Boss   - 
- Tech & Tech Boss     - 

These songs could all be the same:
- Graveyard Song
- Outside Castle Song
- Outside Tech Song
- Sword Room Song

Boss songs all have a similar vibe to the place they are in. Just like houses
should have a similar vibe to the village.
